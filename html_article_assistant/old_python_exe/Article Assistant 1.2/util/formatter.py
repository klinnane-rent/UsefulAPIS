import json


"""
Reads a CSV file with a schema of "city,state,region_id,region_type_id,is_valid" and creates a Python dictionary in
another file as source code. May need to check the contents of the CSV to ensure there is no case like:
Seattle,Wa,WA,12345,6,TRUE

Special characters like in Pe√±a Blanca will be in the dictionary as Pe\u00f1a Blanca due to how PyCharm does encoding
