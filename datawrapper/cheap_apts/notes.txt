Pipeline: 
On first run.  Use bash file: states/creates_dirs.sh to create all the necessary directories.



cheapestCities_datawrapper.py will be called to create the data files.  
TODO: have bigquery calls to DB in this file and put this file on a CRON job.  IF THE NEW FILE IS NOT NEWER THAN THE CURRENT ONE, DO NOT SAVE FILE. 

Lastly:
Run process.py, which should be called from cheapestCities_datawrapper once the files are allegedly created.  It will update or create the charts.
